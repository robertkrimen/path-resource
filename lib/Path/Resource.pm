Path::Resource - URI/Path::Class combination

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.072

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Path::Resource;

  # Map a resource on the local disk to a URI.
  # Its (disk) directory is "/var/dir" and its uri is "http://hostname/loc"
  my $rsc = new Path::Resource dir => "/var/dir", uri => "http://hostname/loc";
  # uri: http://hostname/loc 
  # dir: /var/dir

  my $apple_rsc = $rsc->child("apple");
  # uri: http://hostname/loc/apple
  # dir: /var/dir/apple

  my $banana_txt_rsc = $apple_rsc->child("banana.txt");
  # uri: http://hostname/loc/apple/banana.txt
  # file: /var/dir/apple/banana.txt

  my $size = -s $banana_txt_rsc->file;

  redirect($banana_txt_rsc->uri);
  # Redirect to "http://hostname/loc/apple/banana.txt"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Path::Resource is a module for combining local file and directory manipulation with URI manipulation. It allows you to
effortlessly map local file locations to their URI equivalent.

It combines Path::Class and URI into one object.

Given a base Path::Resource, you can descend (using ->child) or ascend (using ->parent) the path tree while maintaining
URI equivalency, all in one object. 

As a convenience, if you do not need the full URI, you can use the ->loc method to just return the URI path.

=head1 METHODS 

=over 4

=item $rsc = Path::Resource->new

=item $rsc = Path::Resource->new( dir => $dir, uri => $uri, [ path => $path ] )

Create and return a new Path::Resource object using $dir as the base dir and $uri as the base uri.

The URI path of $uri will be automatically extracted and used as the base loc.

If $path is given, then the $rsc will start at that point on the path.

    # For example, if the following $rsc is created like so:
    my $rsc = Path::Resource->new(uri => "http://example.com/a", dir => "/home/b/htdocs", path => "xyzzy");

    my $dir = $rsc->dir; # The dir "/home/b/htdocs/xyzzy"
    my $uri = $rsc->uri; # The uri "http://example.com/a/xyzzy"

    # Note that path doesn't have to be a dir.
    # You can give it a file path if you like (Path::Resource doesn't care)
    $rsc = Path::Resource->new(uri => "http://example.com/a", dir => "/home/b/htdocs", path => "xyzzy/nothing.txt");

    my $file = $rsc->file; # The file "/home/b/htdocs/xyzzy/nothing.txt"
    $uri = $rsc->uri; # The uri "http://example.com/a/xyzzy/nothing.txt"

=item $rsc = Path::Resource->new( dir => $dir, uri => $uri, loc => $loc, [ path => $path ] )

Create and return a new Path::Resource object using $dir as the base dir, $uri as the base uri, and
using $loc as the base loc (the uri path).

If $loc is relative, then it will be appended to $uri->path, otherwise (being absolute) it will replace $uri->path.

If $path is given, then the $rsc will start at that point on the path.

    # For example, if the following $rsc is created like so:
    my $rsc = Path::Resource->new(uri => "http://example.com/a", dir => "/home/b/htdocs", loc => "c");

    my $dir = $rsc->dir; # The dir "/home/b/htdocs"
    my $uri = $rsc->uri; # The uri "http://example.com/a/c"

    # On the other hand:
    $rsc = Path::Resource->new(uri => "http://example.com/a", dir => "/home/b/htdocs", loc => "/g/h");

    $dir = $rsc->dir; # The dir "/home/b/htdocs"
    $uri = $rsc->uri; # The uri "http://example.com/g/h

=item $rsc = Path::Resource->new( file => $file, dir => $dir, uri => $uri, [ loc => $loc, path => $path ] )

Create and return a new Path::Resource object using $dir as the base dir, $uri as the base uri, and
the difference between $file and $dir as the path (literally: $path = $file->relative($dir))

If $loc is given then if it is relative, then it will be appended to $uri->path, otherwise (being absolute) it will replace $uri->path.
